# Backlog / Planned features/improvements

- Disable next-button until answer-button is used, a general UX-improvement.
- Add altSpellings to the API-calls to make sure that things like United Kingdom is a correct guess rather than
 forcing users to type in the full name i.e United Kingdom (Of Great Britain and Northern Ireland).
- Maybe add sounds to all guesses rather than just the end-screen.
- Add media queries to split the content up a bit more on wide/ultrawide screen resolutions.
